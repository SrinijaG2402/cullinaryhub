# Culinary Hub - an online community for local delicacies üë®‚Äçüç≥üç≥
### A github-inspired forum for recipes and food.

The main goal is to create a recipe network that shows how recipes are connected through changes and updates. It's also a place where people can share their ideas and make existing recipes better. 

‚Ä¢ An open-source platform for finding recipes based on cuisines and location.
‚Ä¢ Users can refine searches based on food types and location.
‚Ä¢ Share and discover recipes with other food enthusiasts, add comments and provide reviews.
‚Ä¢ Uploaded recipes from users can be forked just like github.
‚Ä¢ This website has the potential to provide world-wide cultural appreciation and unite everyone with the diverse delicacies around the world (fulfils SDG 11).
